I am a seasoned statistician with technical and managerial experience, as well as a solid background in time-series analysis, geostatistics, and data visualization gained while pursuing a Bachelor of Statistics and a Master of Biostatistics.

While co-founder of H0 Consultoria, I’ve contributed to over 350 scientific studies and 40 business surveys, providing valuable insights to organizations. Following my hands-on technical phase, I advanced to management positions such as R&D, Data and Strategy Manager, and now Services Manager.

As I am passionate about bridging theory and real-world applications, my goal is to empower organizations to make data-driven decisions and optimize their operations using statistical insights.
